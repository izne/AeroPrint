# AeroPrint
Scripts for Thermal network printers that talk ESC/POS commands.

# Pre-requisites
Bash, PHP, ESC/POS printer

# Example with Flight simulation data
In addition to all the nice flight dispatch documents generated by SimBrief, a few small receipts in key moments would be nice during a VATSIM flight:
- METAR/TAF on startup and TOD
- FLP
- FUEL
- Passengers and cargo
- PERF calculations
- PDC
- IFR Clearance and departure "sheet"

A handful of cases where we can print a receipt, use it during the flight and later attach it to the documents for archiving.

# How it works
There is a ESC/POS template (e.g. metar.esc). It contains commands for the printer, much like script for formatting the output on the receipt.

Inside the template file there are placeholders, like %localTime% and %metarData%. They are used to inject the live data. 

The .shell script:
 - Runs the PHP script, which:
    - fetches METAR data from VATSIM)
    - loads the template
    - injects the live data
 - Stores the output (temp.prn) as a temporary file
 - Runs senddat.exe, sending temp.prn over the Ethernet to the IP:PORT of a BIXOLON SRP-300 printer.
